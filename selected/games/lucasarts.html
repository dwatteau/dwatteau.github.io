<h1>LucasArts Selected Versions</h1>

<i>Whenever possible, <a href="https://www.scummvm.org">ScummVM</a> and <a href="https://www.residualvm.org">ResidualVM</a> are recommended to play these versions.</i>

<h2>Maniac Mansion</h2>

<p>NES version.</p>

<p>Less verbs, more compact rooms, more to the point. Too bad that Nintendo censored some stuff.</p>

<h2>Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</h2>

<p>FM-TOWNS version <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/zak_mckracken_and_the_alien_mindbenders">from GOG</a>.</p>

<p>ScummVM has some rendering problems though (such as the length of the intro), and it's a bit strange that the dream-sequence was reversed. And Zak doesn't want to use his bed anymore! But still, the FM-TOWNS version has much, much better art, and it's really nice that GOG sells this rare version.</p>

<h2>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h2>

<p>Regular PC VGA version <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/indiana_jones_and_the_last_crusade">from GOG</a>.</p>

<p>The FM-TOWNS version has some music from the movie, but I don't think that it works very well.</p>

<p>Some colour bugs <a href="http://dustbin.mixnmojo.co/ij3misc.html">could be fixed</a>, though.</p>

<h2>Loom</h2>

<p>Original floppy/EGA version. Hard to find.</p>

<p>It really has a charm and a coherency that's lacking in the other versions, in my opinion. Probably the truest to the original artist's intent.</p>

<h2>The Secret of Monkey Island</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gratissaugen.de/ultimatetalkies/monkey1.html">Ultimate Takie Edition</a>, on top of your Special Edition files.</p>

<p>It picks the excellent voices from the Special Edition, but keeps the original graphics (can't stand the Special Edition graphics), and fixes/improves some stuff. Really well done.</p>

<p>The original floppy/EGA version also has its charm, and some exclusive content. But the <i>Ultimate Talkie Edition</i> is so well done that it wins.</p>

<h2>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gratissaugen.de/ultimatetalkies/monkey2.html">Ultimate Talkie Edition</a>, on top of your Special Edition files.</p>

<p>The graphics from the second Special Edition are better than the ones from the first, but I still prefer the original graphics, and the original use of iMuse (although there's some nice newly recorded music on the Special Edition). Still no contest; the <i>Ultimate Talkie Edition</i> is just excellent.</p>

<h2>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</h2>

<p>Original floppy version (also appears on some CDs). Not that hard to find.</p>

<p>Yes, the non-talkie one! I really don't miss the deadpan voices of the talkie version. I prefer my imagination over a dull interpretation.</p>

<h2>Day of the Tentacle</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/BLooperZ/remonstered">reMONSTERed</a> version, which brings high-quality SFX and speech from the remastered version to the original game files.</p>

<p>The remastered version from Double Fine is fine, but I'm not totally OK with the art (such as Bernard's nose). The original art was a bit limited but really nice, and trying to improve it means that you need to make your own choices about some some ambiguities of the original art. I think I prefer imagining my own version from the original game.</p>

<h2>Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</h2>

<p>Regular PC (or Macintosh) Talkie version.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any different, better version. A remastered version could, at least, bring better-quality speech.</p>

<h2>Full Throttle</h2>

<p>Probably the remastered version from Double Fine.</p>

<p>It's a nice improvement, especially in terms of usuability in the fight scenes.</p>

<h2>The Dig</h2>

<p>Regular PC (or Macintosh) Talkie version.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any different, better version. A remastered version could at least bring better-quality voices.</p>

<h2>The Curse of Monkey Island</h2>

<p>Regular PC version.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any different, better version. A remastered version could really improve the quality of some some compressed art.</p>

<h2>Grim Fandango</h2>

<p>Probably the remastered version from Double Fine.</p>

<p>But it's not a big jump in terms of visuals, and the ResidualVM team also did some wonderful stuff to preserve this game.</p>

<h2>Escape from Monkey Island</h2>

<p><i>Meh.</i></p>

<p>Maybe I should compare at least one the PC and PS2 versions.</p>
