<h1>Bowie Selected Masters</h1>

<h2>RCA Years (1969–1980)</h2>

<i>EMI 1999s are heavily processed and are not recommended at all. Rykos are a bit shrill, but they can be pretty good if you EQ them a bit. Au20s are not worth crazy prices, but sometimes they're a bit better than the regular Rykos (e.g. TMWSTW). Post 2002 remasters are hit and miss. RCA WGs are warm, but sometimes quite veiled. RCA JPNs tend to be more open, but some of them have tape issues. R32Ps are rare, a good amount of them have ripping issues, and I don't think that their EQ beats the other RCAs.</i>

<h3>Space Oddity</h3>

<p>Undecided. It's never going to have a great sound. I kinda like the 2009 remaster and the RCAs, but those miss <i>Don't Sit Down</i>.</p>

<p>What is sure is that you <strong>really</strong> don't want the EMI 1999 or the horrible 2015 Parlophone with its gigantic tape issues.</p>

<h3>The Man Who Sold the World</h3>

<p>WG calms down the sound, but it's really, <em>really</em> muddy. It just sounds like a poor tape. I used to like it, but now I don't think I would recommend it at all.</p>

<p>JPN is clear, but it's quite bright/excessive and I already find this album fatiguing.</p>

<p>Parlophone 2015 is nice, but it sounds a bit veiled, as if something was lost and could not be EQ'd back.</p>

<p>So I think that you'd get the best sound if you re-EQ the RCA JPN or the Ryko Au20 a bit.</p>

<h3>Hunky Dory</h3>

<p>RCA WG or 2015 remaster.</p>

<p>Maybe, pick one of the earliest LPs, to avoid the tape issues on some tracks.</p>

<h3>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</h3>

<p>Out of the three RCAs, I'd say that the JPN for US has a <em>bit</em> more body, but that's minimal. Be warned that all the RCAs have tape dropouts.</p>

<p>2012 remaster is maybe not that bad? Also need to compare a bit more the DSD layer of the SACD.</p>

<p>The very earliest UK LPs are also of interest: original "loud" version of <i>Starman</i>, and no tape dropouts.</p>

<h3>Aladdin Sane</h3>

<p>JPN for US CSR. A bit bright/excessive, but it just suits the music and Bowie's personna at the time, I think.</p>

<p>JPN for EUR is a bit smoother and may sound a bit more musical, but it can also appear a bit veiled. Not a bad CD, though!</p>

<h3>Pin Ups</h3>

<p>The differences between the two RCAs and the Parlophone are pretty small; no clear winner, they all sound good.</p>

<p>My personal preference goes to the JPN for EUR, because I find it a bit less fatiguing, and it has better track indexing than the JPN for US. But I could really live with any of these.</p>

<h3>Diamond Dogs</h3>

<p>RCA JPN is probably the best. 2017 Parlophone and Ryko are quite OK, too.</p>

<p>RCA WG has the exclusivity of the <em>real</em> complete intro to <i>Future Legend</i>, but in general the sound is really poor.</p>

<h3>Young Americans</h3>

<p>RCA JPN for US has the best drum sound, in my opinion. But it's a bit hissy between tracks, and title track intro is cut. The WG has a similar sound, and doesn't have these problems. So, either of them.</p>

<p>2007 remaster is almost a remix and its treatments sound too modern for a 1975 record. Parlophone is veiled.</p>

<p>Ryko and Au20 don't use the proper mixes.</p>

<h3>Station to Station</h3>

<p>RCA WG is EQ'd a lot, but it shines, in my opinion. 2010 remaster is pretty good as well, but it's a bit duller.</p>

<h3>Low</h3>

<p>Again, RCA WG works really nicely on the Alomar/Murray/Davis rhythm section. Visconti's recent remaster is… err… less subtle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the WG misses the intro of some tracks, and the JPN for US has unbalanced channels.</p>

<h3>“Heroes”</h3>

<p>WG sounds too muddy, so JPN for US by default (missing intro noise to <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, though.).</p>

<p>2017 remaster not that bad, but not that good either (it's a bit boomy).</p>

<h3>Lodger</h3>

<p>RCA WG, for the same reason as <i>Station to Station</i> and <i>Low</i>.</p>

<p>Although the JPN for US deserves its own test, if you can ignore its audio glitches on two tracks.</p>

<h3>Scary Monsters… and Super Creeps</h3>

<p>RCA JPN, although RCA WG is OK. The RCA JPN has a bit of pre-echo between some tracks, but it's a bit less fatiguing than the WG.</p>

<p>A re-EQ'd Ryko could be pretty good, too.</p>

<p>The DSD layer from the SACD is almost a remix, and more of a <i>in-your-face</i> one.</p>

<h2>Phil Collins Years (1983–1987)</h2>

<h3>Let's Dance</h3>

<p>Original CD without any barcode is really, really nice, sexy smooth &amp; round sound. A bit of pre-echo, though.</p>

<h3>Tonight</h3>

<p>I don't really like the sound of the original, or 1995 remaster. Need to investigate the 2018 remaster?</p>

<h3>Never Let Me Down</h3>

<p>Original 1987 CD is acceptable.</p>

<h2>Tin Machine Years</h2>

<p><i>Probably just the original CDs, out of habit.</i></p>

<h2>Arista Year (1993)</h2>

<h3>Black Tie White Noise / The Buddha of Suburbia</h3>

<p><em>Maybe</em> one case of a remaster being better than the original? Need to compare the 1993/2003 editions more.</p>

<h2>Unique Digital Mastering Years (1995–1999)</h2>

<h3>Outside</h3>

<p>There's just a single digital master; it clips but it's still pretty good, especially in the general use of dynamics on this album. I don't think the LP version could sound much better, especially when you consider the length of the record.</p>

<h3>Earthling</h3>

<p>Pro Tools abuse intensifies. Tolerable CD; need to investigate the two (three?) LP versions.</p>

<h3>'hours...'</h3>

<p>MOV version sounds just like the CD version put on an LP. Some <i>Omikron</i> versions sound a bit less bloated, but it looks like there is a frequency cut?</p>

<h2>The “maybe an SACD?” years (2002–2003)</h2>

<h3>Heathen</h3>

<p>Downmixing the 5.1 DSD layer of the SACD gives air, but doesn't sound really good (<i>A Better Future</i> loses its bass). Maybe an LP?</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>

<p>Yet another 2000s mastering piece of garbage from Emily Lazar, yay. This time, downmixing the 5.1 DSD layer of the SACD gives air, <em>and</em> I like the resulting mix.</p>

<p>LP is probably good as well.</p>

<h2>The “let's trash the dynamics a bit less” years (2013–2016)</h2>

<h3>The Next Day</h3>

<p>A bit less digital abuse, but people deserve better. Some think that the LP version is way better, but I just hear a really similar digital master being put to vinyl. I think it's not just the master being too hot, but that the mix was already done quite hot, to begin with.</p>

<h3>Blackstar</h3>

<p>I think that modern compression is getting smarter. Better dynamics that the two previous albums. It still lacks air and it's still too fatiguing, but given the subject matter, the oppressive mix can “work”.</p>

<p>Again, I don't hear much differences between the digital and LP version. It looks like people's ears think it's more dynamic <em>after</em> having read some number on the Dynamic Range DB. But I don't think that the TT DR Offline Meter has any meaning when comparing LP and CD releases.</p>

<p>The <i>Mastered for iTunes</i> version sounds a bit different, don't know if it's better. Needs a proper comparison.</p>

<h2>Live stuff</h2>

<p>I just tend to prefer the latest versions, because they have more tracks, and livelier mixes.</p>

<p>For <i>Live Santa Monica '72</i>, grab the promo version and drop the 2 second pause between tracks, you'll avoid some unnecessary and excessive compression from the official release. For <i>Live Nassau Coliseum '76</i>, just grab the LP, because the CD is brickwalled to death (better digital version must exist for this one; as hinted in the Ryko bonuses, <i>RarestOneBowie</i> compilation and <i>Strangers When We Meet</i> 2007 Target exclusive).</p>
