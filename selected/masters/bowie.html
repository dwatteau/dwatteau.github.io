<h1>Bowie Selected Masters</h1>

<h2>RCA Years (1969–1980)</h2>

<h3>Space Oddity</h3>

<p>Undecided. Something between the RCA JPN, the RCA WG or maybe the 2009 remaster (the RCAs miss <i>Don't Sit Down</i>).</p>

<p>2015 remaster has huge tape issues; avoid at all cost.</p>

<h3>The Man Who Sold the World</h3>

<p>WG calms down the sound, but it's really muddy. JPN is clear, but it's quite bright/excessive and I already find this album fatiguing.</p>

<p>So maybe the 2015 remaster, or a sligthly re-EQ'd JPN?</p>

<h3>Hunky Dory</h3>

<p>RCA WG or 2015 remaster.</p>

<p>Maybe, pick one of the earliest LPs, to avoid the tape issues on some tracks.</p>

<h3>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</h3>

<p>I don't really like <i>Ziggy</i>… didn't do any serious comparison yet, sorry. Be warned that the RCAs have tape dropouts.</p>

<p>Maybe one of the very earliest UK LPs? Looks like it was the only version using the proper master tape.</p>

<h3>Pin Ups</h3>

<p>Lesser album. RCA JPN and 2015 remasters sound really good. RCA WG is a bit gentler.</p>

<h3>Aladdin Sane</h3>

<p>JPN for US CSR. A bit bright/excessive, but it just suits the music and Bowie's personna at the time, I think.</p>

<p>WG is smoother.</p>

<h3>Diamond Dogs</h3>

<p>RCA JPN or 2017 remasters are good. RCA WG has the exclusivity of the <em>real</em> complete intro to <i>Future Legend</i>.</p>

<h3>Young Americans</h3>

<p>RCA JPN for US has the best drum sound, in my opinion. But it's a bit hissy between tracks, title track intro is cut, and it's not perfect.</p>

<p>2007 remaster is almost a remix and its treatments sound too modern for a 1975 record. Same thing for <i>The Gouster</i>.</p>

<h3>Station to Station</h3>

<p>RCA WG shines. 2010 is pretty good as well.</p>

<h3>Low</h3>

<p>Again, RCA WG works really nicely on the Alomar/Murray/Davis rhythm section. Visconti's recent remaster is… err… less subtle.</p>

<h3>“Heroes”</h3>

<p>WG sounds too muddy, so JPN by default (missing intro noise to <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, though.).</p>

<p>2017 remaster not that bad, but not that good either.</p>

<h3>Lodger</h3>

<p>RCA WG, for the same reason as <i>Station to Station</i> and <i>Low</i>.</p>

<h3>Scary Monsters… and Super Creeps</h3>

<p>RCA JPN, although RCA WG is good as well.</p>

<p>The DSD layer from the SACD is almost a remix, and more of a <i>in-your-face</i> one.</p>

<h2>Phil Collins Years (1983–1987)</h2>

<h3>Let's Dance</h3>

<p>Original CD without any barcode is really, really nice, sexy smooth &amp; round sound.</p>

<h3>Tonight</h3>

<p>I don't really like the sound of the original, or 1995 remaster. Need to investigate the 2018 remaster?</p>

<h3>Never Let Me Down</h3>

<p>Original 1987 CD is acceptable.</p>

<h2>Tin Machine Years</h2>

<p><i>Probably just the original CDs, out of habit.</i></p>

<h2>Arista Year (1993)</h2>

<h3>Black Tie White Noise / The Buddha of Suburbia</h3>

<p><em>Maybe</em> one case of a remaster being better than the original? Need to compare the 1993/2003 editions more.</p>

<h2>Unique Digital Mastering Years (1995–1999)</h2>

<h3>Outside</h3>

<p>Single digital master; it clips but it's still pretty good, especially in the general use of dynamics on this album. I don't think the LP version could sound much better, especially when you consider the length of the record.</p>

<h3>Earthling</h3>

<p>Pro Tools abuse intensifies. Tolerable CD; need to investigate the two (three?) LP versions.</p>

<h3>'hours...'</h3>

<p>MOV version sounds just like the CD version put on an LP. Some <i>Omikron</i> versions sound a bit less bloated, but lesser frequencies?</p>

<h2>The “maybe an SACD?” years (2002–2003)</h2>

<h3>Heathen</h3>

<p>Downmixing the 5.1 DSD layer of the SACD gives air, but doesn't good really good (<i>A Better Future</i> loses its bass). Maybe an LP?</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>

<p>Yet another 2000s mastering piece of garbage from Emily Lazar, yay. This time, downmixing the 5.1 DSD layer of the SACD gives air, <em>and</em> I like the resulting mix. LP is probably good as well.</p>

<h2>The “let's trash the dynamics a bit less” years (2013–2016)</h2>

<h3>The Next Day</h3>

<p>A bit less digital abuse, but people deserve better. Some think that the LP version is way better, but I just hear a really similar digital master being put to vinyl. I think it's not just the master being too hot, but that the mix was already done quite hot, to begin with.</p>

<h3>Blackstar</h3>

<p>I think that modern compression is getting smarter. Better dynamics that the two previous albums. It still lacks air and it's still too fatiguing, but given the subject matter, the oppressive mix can “work”.</p>

<p>Again, I don't hear much differences between the digital and LP version. It looks like people's ears think it's more dynamic <em>after</em> having read some number on the Dynamic Range DB. But I don't think that the TT DR Offline Meter has any meaning when comparing LP and CD releases.</p>

<p>The <i>Mastered for iTunes</i> version sounds a bit different, don't know if it's better. Needs a proper comparison.</p>

<h2>Live stuff</h2>

<p>I just tend to prefer the latest versions, because they have more tracks, and livelier mixes.</p>

<p>For <i>Live Santa Monica '72</i>, grab the promo version and drop the 2 second pause between tracks, you'll avoid some unnecessary and excessive compression. For <i>Live Nassau Coliseum '76</i>, just grab the LP, because the CD is brickwalled to death (better digital version must exist for this one; as hinted in the Ryko bonuses, <i>RarestOneBowie</i> compilation and <i>Strangers When We Meet</i> 2007 Target exclusive).</p>
